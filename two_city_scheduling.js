// takes in a cost array of arrays [[]]
// each array has a pair of numbers
// the first number is the cost of flying 1st person to city a
// the second number is the cost of flying 1st person to city b
// return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city so that every person arrives in a city
// ex. Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
// Output: 110
// Explanation: 
// The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
// The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
// The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
// The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
